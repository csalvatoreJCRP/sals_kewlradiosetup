A simple menu system to use with WhackerLink FiveM integrated radio system

Here is a video of the menu in action: https://youtu.be/pvinvg3nCfU

This was created and used by our community, Jersey Coast RP (discord.jcrp.net) to make it easy for our players to access their two-way radio. 

Current features are:
* It will remember the player's radio ID and codeplug between sessions (saved as metadata)
* Config.lua contains a variety of configuration options
* Only specific jobs can open the menu
* Command to open the menu is controlled via config.lua
* Mouse-driven menu
* QB-Core requirement at this time
* Codeplug selections are based on job (multiple jobs per codeplug)
* Simply uses the execute command to interact with the FiveM script for WhackerLink

I appreciate what WhackerLink has brought to not only the FiveM community, but to the radio community also!  I will continue to incorporate changes as needed.

Requirements:
* Qb-Core
* WhackerLink FiveM & WhackerLink Server
